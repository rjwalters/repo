# /repo:clean — Tidy Up

Sweep the working tree for clutter and clean it up. Report-first: inventory
everything, categorize by confidence, then delete only what the user approves
(or only the SAFE category with `--apply`).

## Usage

```
/repo:clean                    # Inventory + report, then discuss
/repo:clean --apply            # Report, then delete the SAFE category without asking per-item
/repo:clean packages/core      # Scope to one subtree
```

## Steps

### 1. Inventory

Gather candidates without deleting anything:

```bash
# Ignored files that exist on disk (usually build output/caches)
git clean -ndX

# Untracked files (may include work-in-progress — treat carefully)
git clean -nd

# Empty directories
find . -type d -empty -not -path './.git/*'

# Large files in the working tree (>10 MB, tracked or not)
find . -type f -size +10M -not -path './.git/*' -not -path './node_modules/*'

# Stale worktrees
git worktree list
```

Also look for junk by pattern, wherever it lives:
- OS/editor droppings: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*~`, `*.swp`, `.#*`
- Python: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`
- JS: `node_modules/` outside package roots, stale `dist/`, `.turbo/`, coverage output
- Logs and temp files: `*.log`, `*.tmp`, `tmp/` contents older than a week
- Merge/patch leftovers: `*.orig`, `*.rej`, `*.BACKUP.*`

### 2. Categorize

- **SAFE** — regenerable with certainty: gitignored build output and caches,
  OS/editor droppings, `__pycache__`, empty directories. Nothing in this
  category may be tracked by git or match a source-code extension.
- **ASK** — probably junk but needs a human call: untracked files that aren't
  gitignored (could be unsaved work!), large files, stale-looking logs, old
  `tmp/` contents, stale worktrees and their branches (hand off to
  [[branches]] for those).
- **KEEP** — flagged only as information: tracked files that look like they
  don't belong (build output that got committed — point to [[gitignore]]).

### 3. Report

```
## Repo Clean — inventory

SAFE (would free 412 MB):
  .DS_Store × 14
  __pycache__/ × 22 dirs
  dist/ (gitignored, 380 MB)
  6 empty directories

ASK:
  notes-scratch.md         untracked, 3 KB, modified today  ← might be real work
  sim-output-old/          untracked, 1.2 GB, untouched 60 days
  worktree: ../repo-wt-fix123 (branch merged)

KEEP (informational):
  assets/build.min.js      tracked but looks generated — see /repo:gitignore
```

### 4. Apply

- Without `--apply`: walk through categories with the user; delete what they
  approve.
- With `--apply`: delete the SAFE category immediately, then present ASK items
  as usual. Never auto-delete anything in ASK, no matter the flags.

Use `git clean -fdX -- <paths>` for gitignored artifacts and plain `rm` only
for pattern-matched junk you listed in the report. After deleting, re-run the
inventory to confirm and report bytes freed.

## Safety Rules

1. **Never delete tracked files** — that's a git operation the user does deliberately
2. **Never touch `.git/`** internals
3. **Untracked ≠ junk** — an untracked file modified recently is presumed to be
   unsaved work and always lands in ASK
4. **Everything deleted must have appeared in the report first**
5. When scoped to a subtree, do not delete anything outside it
