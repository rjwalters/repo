#!/usr/bin/env bash
# repo-remote.sh — headless, scriptable entry point for /repo:remote provisioning.
#
# This is the non-interactive implementation of the provisioning contract
# documented (as prose) in commands/repo/remote.md. The interactive skill wraps
# this script with its wizard / cost-confirmation UX and, once the human has
# confirmed, calls `repo-remote up --yes`; a caller such as loom's
# `fleet add-worker` invokes the same `up --yes --json` path directly. There is
# ONE implementation of the contract so the two paths cannot drift (repo#52).
#
# The seam this produces, consumed by loom fleet orchestration: "a reachable
# Ubuntu box, this repo's SSH alias written, instance id recorded" — emitted as
# machine-readable JSON (instance id, public IP, SSH alias, estimated hourly
# cost) so a caller can implement loom's "plan shown before money is spent" rule.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# STABLE INTERFACE (downstream tooling gates on this via the package version)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Subcommands (both the `up`/`down`/`status` verbs and the remote.md-style
# `--status`/`--down` flags are accepted, for parity with the prose command):
#
#   repo-remote up [--yes] [--force] [--json] [aws|gcp]   Provision (or reuse)
#       an instance.
#       Without --yes: a DRY-RUN plan (resolved spec + estimated cost) is emitted
#       and NOTHING is created — this is the "plan shown before money spent" path.
#       With --yes: the plan is executed. --yes removes the *prompt*, never the
#       *consent requirement*: a cost-relevant field missing from config is a
#       loud, non-zero-exit failure, never a silent default (repo#52 cost gate).
#       --force overrides the fleet-marker guard described below. It does NOT
#       relax the cost gate.
#
#   repo-remote status|--status [--json] [aws|gcp]   List instances this command
#       created (tagged repo-remote=<name>) with state; no mutation.
#
#   repo-remote verify|--verify [--json] [aws|gcp]   Prove the SSH alias still
#       reaches THIS repo's instance before anything is trusted to it. Opens one
#       SSH session over repo-remote-<name>, asks the host for its OWN instance
#       id, and compares it with the id this repo expects (a pinned
#       REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID, else the repo-remote=<name> tag). Exits 6 on a
#       mismatch AND on any answer it cannot establish (unreachable host, no
#       identity source) — it fails CLOSED, because "I could not tell" is not
#       evidence that the host is the right one. See "Host-identity
#       verification" below. No cloud mutation; no cloud call at all when the
#       instance id is pinned.
#
#   repo-remote down|--down [--yes] [--force] [--json] [aws|gcp]   Teardown.
#       Without --yes: a DRY-RUN listing of exactly what would stop/terminate
#       (fleet-marked instances, if any, are annotated but never block a dry
#       run — see the fleet-marker guard below).
#       With --yes: stop them; add --delete to terminate (disk goes with it).
#       --force overrides the fleet-marker guard described below, same as `up`.
#
#   repo-remote attach|--attach [--container|--host] [--command <cmd>] [aws|gcp]
#       Open a session on THIS repo's existing instance, carrying a freshly
#       resolved GitHub credential (repo#565). It is the credential-aware
#       connect AND reconnect entry point: every attach resolves the
#       credential again, so re-running it after a short-lived token expires
#       gives the new session a new token while reusing the same instance and
#       container (nothing is provisioned, started, or stopped; no cloud
#       mutation at all). Order, each step gating the next:
#         1. validate config (transport, gateway, repo name) — no network;
#         2. open ONE SSH master connection over repo-remote-<name> and verify
#            the host identity over it exactly like `verify` (exit 6 on a
#            mismatch or an unverifiable host — fails closed);
#         3. only then resolve the credential (run REPO_REMOTE_GH_TOKEN_CMD, or
#            read the static REPO_REMOTE_GH_TOKEN) — exit 7 if the command
#            fails, with NO fallback to the static token;
#         4. open the session over that same verified master connection, with
#            the token carried as an SSH environment value (never argv), and
#            land in the dev container (`docker exec`) when it is running,
#            else in ~/<repo> on the host. --container / --host force one;
#            --command runs <cmd> non-interactively instead of a login shell.
#       Processes already running on the VM keep the environment they started
#       with; only the new attachment sees the replacement token.
#       See "GitHub credentials on the VM" below.
#
# Config: two layers, shared first then repo (repo overrides), matching the
# skill exactly:
#   1. ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/repo/remote.env   (shared cloud creds)
#   2. <git-root>/.env                                     (per-repo machine)
#
# Out-of-tree per-repo config (repo#492): some repos forbid ANY `.env` in the
# checkout or its worktrees (worktrees are copied/rsynced constantly, and a
# gitignored file is one `git add -f` away from leaking). For them, set
# REPO_REMOTE_ENV_FILE=<absolute path> -- in the process environment or in the
# shared remote.env -- and layer 2 becomes that file instead of
# <git-root>/.env (a leading `~/` is expanded; the environment value wins over
# the shared file's). The instance-id write-back goes there too.
#
# Instance-id write-back never CREATES <git-root>/.env: it updates the resolved
# per-repo file when REPO_REMOTE_ENV_FILE is set (creating that file if
# needed) or when <git-root>/.env already exists; otherwise it only logs the id
# with a hint to pin it. REPO_REMOTE_NO_WRITEBACK=1 disables the write-back
# entirely (the id is still logged).
#
# Linked-worktree warning (repo#538): when the checkout is a LINKED git
# worktree (`git worktree add`, e.g. .loom/worktrees/issue-N -- detected by
# `git rev-parse --git-dir` differing from `--git-common-dir`) and no
# REPO_REMOTE_ENV_FILE is set, reading a pre-existing <git-root>/.env or writing
# the instance id back into it prints a loud WARNING naming the file. The
# read/write still happens (warn-then-proceed); the fix is to move the per-repo
# settings out of the tree and set REPO_REMOTE_ENV_FILE. The primary checkout
# is unaffected (no warning).
#
# Cost gate (repo#52 — the highest-cost-of-being-wrong element): `up` (with or
# without --yes) REQUIRES the provider, that provider's credentials, and
# REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_TYPE to be present in config. Instance type is the
# cost-relevant field and is NEVER defaulted here — that removes interactivity,
# not consent. Non-cost-relevant fields (disk, idle window, image) do fall back
# to built-in defaults, matching the prose command.
#
# Fleet-marker guard (repo#164, repo#170): both `up` and `down` resolve an
# instance from the SAME two never-expiring handles — a pinned
# REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID, or one carrying the repo-remote=<name> tag/label
# (`down`'s tag-discovery path can resolve more than one). That resolution is
# stale-tag-prone: a host provisioned once for an ephemeral dev session can
# later become a persistent fleet worker while still carrying the repo-remote
# tag, at which point this ephemeral tooling would happily reuse it
# (operator incident, private tracker). `down` is the strictly worse case: it STOPS the resolved
# instance, or — with --delete — TERMINATES it, disk and all, unrecoverable.
# So before `up` starts/aliases a REUSED instance, or `down` stops/terminates
# any resolved instance, its tags (AWS) / labels (GCP) are checked for a fleet
# marker — by default Fleet=loom, configurable via REPO_REMOTE_FLEET_TAG_KEY /
# REPO_REMOTE_FLEET_TAG_VALUE. If present, the run STOPS (exit 5) with a clear
# message unless --force is given; with --force it proceeds after a loud
# warning. `down` refuses the WHOLE resolved batch if ANY id in it carries the
# marker, rather than silently acting on a subset. Setting
# REPO_REMOTE_FLEET_TAG_KEY= (empty) disables the check entirely. The guard
# never applies to a freshly created instance (nothing to inherit) and never to
# a dry run (which touches no cloud resource at all) — a `down` dry run
# annotates any fleet-marked instances in its listing instead of blocking.
#
# Host-identity verification (repo#458): an EC2 auto-assigned public IPv4 is
# RELEASED when the instance stops and a different one is assigned on its next
# start — and the released address is handed to whoever starts an instance next,
# very possibly another AWS customer entirely. The SSH alias this script writes
# is therefore only as fresh as the last `up` (or `verify`) run: nothing keeps it
# current between sessions. In the incident behind this check, a stopped/started
# box's old address came back up on a stranger's instance, the unchanged alias
# resolved, ssh connected, key auth succeeded, and three agents wrote work
# products to a machine that was not theirs. Every signal the tooling had said
# "fine".
#
# So `up` (after it writes the alias) and the standalone `verify` subcommand both
# ask the reached host for its OWN instance id and compare it against the id this
# repo expects. The id is read, in order, from: the marker file this tool drops at
# provision time (REPO_REMOTE_HOST_ID_FILE, default /etc/repo-remote-instance-id),
# the instance metadata service (IMDSv2, then IMDSv1, then GCP's), and finally
# cloud-init's /var/lib/cloud/data/instance-id — so an instance provisioned before
# the marker existed is still verifiable. A MISMATCH always exits 6, in both
# paths; --force does NOT override it (that flag is the fleet-marker override and
# nothing else). The two paths differ only on an answer that could not be
# established at all:
#   verify  — exits 6. Fails CLOSED: it exists precisely to be run before an
#             agent trusts a session it did not just create.
#   up      — warns loudly and continues. `up` resolved the IP from the cloud API
#             and rewrote the alias in the SAME run, so the alias is fresh by
#             construction there; failing the run on an IMDS-locked-down or
#             pre-marker box would break provisioning for no safety gain.
# Pinning REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID is the recommended configuration for any
# session expected to survive a stop/start: it makes the expectation explicit
# rather than re-derived from a tag that a fleet host can also be wearing.
#
# AWS root volume (repo#559): the root EBS volume is launched EXPLICITLY typed,
# never left to the AMI default (gp2, whose 3 IOPS/GiB baseline — 150 IOPS at
# 50 GiB — leaves sustained builds/tests stalled in disk wait once its burst
# credits drain). Settings, all AWS-only, resolved through the same two config
# layers as everything else:
#   REPO_REMOTE_DISK_GB            root volume size in GiB (default 50)
#   REPO_REMOTE_VOLUME_TYPE        gp3 (default) | gp2
#   REPO_REMOTE_VOLUME_IOPS        gp3 only; default 3000 (the gp3 baseline)
#   REPO_REMOTE_VOLUME_THROUGHPUT  gp3 only, MiB/s; default 125 (the baseline)
# They are validated BEFORE any cloud call (exit 2): an unsupported type, a
# non-positive-integer value, IOPS/throughput set alongside gp2, or a gp3 value
# outside AWS's documented limits (IOPS 3000-80000 and <= 500 per GiB;
# throughput 125-2000 MiB/s and <= 0.25 MiB/s per provisioned IOPS) is refused.
# On REUSE, `up` inspects the instance's actual root volume and, if it is gp2,
# prints a stderr advisory with the copyable `aws ec2 modify-volume` command and
# the `ec2:ModifyVolume` permission it needs. It never runs that command, and a
# failed inspection is a notice, never a failed `up`.
#
# AWS transport (repo#564): how `up`/`verify` reach the box, AWS-only, resolved
# through the same two config layers:
#   REPO_REMOTE_TRANSPORT          ssh (default) | ssm
#   REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_PROFILE   optional IAM instance profile NAME, passed to
#                                  run-instances as --iam-instance-profile
#                                  Name=<name> on a fresh launch. A profile alone
#                                  never changes the transport.
# ssh (default) is the behavior described above: a public IP, a per-caller /32
# tcp/22 rule, and an alias whose HostName is that IP. ssm reaches the box over
# AWS Systems Manager Session Manager instead: the alias's HostName is the
# instance ID and a ProxyCommand runs `aws ssm start-session --region <region>
# --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters portNumber=22`.
# SSH user/key authentication is unchanged; readiness, the host-identity probe,
# interactive ssh, and rsync all go through that alias. Under ssm:
#   * a FRESH launch requires REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_PROFILE (exit 2 before any
#     mutation otherwise) and gets a tool-owned security group tagged
#     repo-remote-ssm=<name> with NO inbound rule. An explicit
#     REPO_REMOTE_SECURITY_GROUP, or a previously created SSM group, that has
#     any inbound rule is refused (exit 2) — its rules are never deleted.
#   * no ingress is authorized or revoked, no current-IP lookup is made, and no
#     public IP is polled — on create OR reuse. A reused instance's existing
#     exposure is reported, never "fixed", and a reused instance without an
#     instance profile gets a warning (a role is never attached automatically).
#   * the local `session-manager-plugin` must be installed (exit 2 before any
#     cloud call otherwise; REPO_REMOTE_SSM_PLUGIN overrides the binary name).
#   * the readiness probe retries the agent-registration delay
#     (TargetNotConnected) within REPO_REMOTE_SSH_READY_TIMEOUT, fails at once on
#     an access denial or a missing plugin, and never falls back to direct SSH.
# Invalid values (an unknown transport, ssm or a profile with GCP, a malformed
# profile name, a region that is not a plain AWS region code) exit 2 before any
# cloud call. The `up` JSON gains additive "transport", "connect_target" (the
# alias HostName: IP or instance ID) and "instance_profile" fields; under ssm
# "public_ip" is "" because none is looked up.
#
# GitHub credentials on the VM (repo#565): `attach` is the only subcommand
# that touches a dev-session credential; `up` (dry run or --yes), `status`,
# `verify` and `down` never run the token command or send a token anywhere.
# Settings, resolved through the same two config layers (repo wins):
#   REPO_REMOTE_GH_TOKEN_CMD   RECOMMENDED. A command run LOCALLY by
#                              `bash -c` (stdin </dev/null) whose stdout is the
#                              token, e.g. a GitHub App installation-token
#                              minter. When non-empty it takes precedence over
#                              REPO_REMOTE_GH_TOKEN. It runs with this
#                              process's environment and the operator's own
#                              trust (the config files are already sourced as
#                              shell); it may use local credentials, which are
#                              never transmitted — only its stdout is. Fails
#                              closed (exit 7, nothing sent, no static-token
#                              fallback) on a non-zero exit, empty output,
#                              more than one line, or any whitespace/control
#                              character in the token. Its stdout and stderr
#                              are never displayed.
#   REPO_REMOTE_GH_TOKEN       a static token (legacy). Still delivered the same
#                              way, with a one-line notice recommending the
#                              command form. Never written anywhere.
#   REPO_REMOTE_GH_API_HOST    optional API gateway hostname (bare DNS name, no
#                              scheme/port/path; github.com and *.github.com
#                              refused). The gateway must serve the GitHub
#                              Enterprise Server API layout over HTTPS with a
#                              certificate the VM trusts (gh offers no
#                              verification bypass). The session then gets
#                              GH_HOST=<gw>, GH_REPO=<gw>/<owner>/<repo> (from
#                              this checkout's github.com origin) and the token
#                              as GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN, with GH_TOKEN emptied —
#                              gh would otherwise talk to github.com directly.
#                              git keeps its github.com remote and authenticates
#                              there with the same token. Invalid values exit 2
#                              before anything connects.
# Delivery: the token travels as the SSH environment value
# LC_REPO_REMOTE_GH_TOKEN (SendEnv; Ubuntu's stock sshd has `AcceptEnv LANG
# LC_*`) on a session multiplexed over the verified master connection. The
# remote bootstrap unsets that variable and exports the token only into the
# process it starts: `docker exec -e GH_TOKEN` (name only — exec environment
# is not part of the container's persisted configuration) or the host login
# shell. git is pointed at it through GIT_CONFIG_* environment entries that
# reset any configured github.com credential helper (so no `store` helper can
# persist it) and add one that reads the variable by NAME. Nothing is written
# to remote.env, the per-repo config, the SSH config, or the VM's disk; no
# `gh auth login`, no stored git credential.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success (including a dry-run plan)
#   2  missing / invalid required config (the cost gate; loud failure) — also
#      the SSH-ingress fail-closed refusals: current-IP detection failed and no
#      REPO_REMOTE_SSH_CIDR was pinned, or the pinned CIDR is wider than
#      REPO_REMOTE_SSH_MIN_PREFIX without REPO_REMOTE_ALLOW_WORLD_SSH=1
#      (repo#487)
#   3  provider authentication failed
#   4  cloud operation failed
#   5  refused to act (reuse via `up`, stop/terminate via `down`) on a
#      fleet-marked instance (pass --force to override)
#   6  host-identity verification failed — the host reachable at the SSH alias
#      is not the instance this repo expects, or its identity could not be
#      established (NOT overridable with --force)
#   7  `attach` could not resolve the dev-session credential:
#      REPO_REMOTE_GH_TOKEN_CMD failed or printed a malformed token. Nothing
#      was sent to the VM and the static token was NOT used instead.

# ── the fleet-marker guard (reuse discovery, repo#164) ──────────────────────
# `up` never re-attaches user-data to an instance it reuses — the guard a host
# carries is whatever it got at its one-time creation. What reuse DOES do is
# start a stopped instance and rewrite this repo's SSH alias to point at it. The
# instance it reaches is resolved from a pinned REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID or from
# the repo-remote=<name> tag/label, and neither of those handles expires: a box
# provisioned once as an ephemeral dev session can since have become a
# persistent, daemon-managed fleet worker while still carrying the old tag. That
# is exactly how `repo-remote=anvil` tooling kept rediscovering a fleet host
# after it became a fleet host (operator incident, private tracker).
#
# So: before a REUSED instance is started or aliased, look for a fleet marker
# the fleet-management side already had to set deliberately elsewhere. This is a
# provisioning-time check against declared metadata — deliberately NOT an
# on-host "is some process running" heuristic, which repo#79 rejected for the
# guard's runtime logic and which nothing here reopens.

# True when a discovered marker value counts as "this is a fleet host".

# ── the idle-shutdown guard (cloud-init user-data) ──────────────────────────
# A forgotten VM — GPU ones especially — must turn itself off. Emitted as a
# cloud-init script that installs a cron watchdog running `shutdown -h` after
# IDLE_MIN minutes with no active SSH session and low CPU.
#
# "Activity" is defined by exactly two local signals: an open SSH session (`who`)
# OR CPU load average > 0.2. There is NO process-name veto — a running daemon
# (loom-daemon or otherwise) does NOT, by itself, keep this host alive. If a
# future daemon-presence veto is ever wanted it must be added deliberately here
# and documented; it is not implied by the current logic.
#
# BACKGROUND JOBS DO NOT HOLD THIS GUARD (repo#451). A job started over a single
# non-interactive SSH command — `ssh <alias> 'nohup make -j8 &'` and friends —
# stops counting as activity via `who` the MOMENT that ssh command returns: the
# login shell that ran it has already exited, so there is no session left for
# `who` to report. From then on the job is protected ONLY by its own CPU usage
# keeping the load average above 0.2, and there is no process-name veto to fall
# back on. A long build with I/O-bound or license-wait lulls can dip under that
# threshold for a full IDLE_MIN window and be powered off mid-run (the reported
# incident: a ~20-minute nohup'd build killed by a 120-minute window's guard).
# For work that may go CPU-idle, either hold a real session for its duration
# (`tmux`/`screen` on the host, or an interactive SSH session left open) or size
# REPO_REMOTE_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_MIN to the job.
#
# Idle-exit marker contract (published by this repo so a daemon side can conform
# without this repo depending on it): when $IDLE_MARKER exists on-host, the guard
# treats its mtime as an authoritative "idle since" timestamp and shuts down
# IDLE_MIN minutes after that mtime — REPLACING (not supplementing) its own
# $STAMP-based countdown start for that pass. A daemon that idle-exits cleanly can
# `touch` this file to hand the guard a precise idle-start instead of waiting for
# the guard's own load-average sampling to first read idle. The guard works
# standalone: with no marker file present it falls back to the unchanged
# who/load/$STAMP behavior. The marker path is always embedded (default below,
# overridable via REPO_REMOTE_IDLE_MARKER) so the branch is inert-but-ready.
#
# IDLE_MIN <= 0 means "guard disabled" (repo#163) — the opt-out an operator
# reaches for via REPO_REMOTE_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_MIN=0, e.g. for a fleet-tagged host
# that should never self-shutdown. This must NOT be handled by feeding 0 into
# the generated script's `(NOW - LAST) / 60 -ge IDLE_MIN` arithmetic — that
# makes the guard fire almost immediately (0 >= 0 is true on the very first
# post-$STAMP tick) instead of never. So the window is validated here, before
# any guard/cron script is emitted at all: a non-positive (or non-numeric)
# IDLE_MIN short-circuits to no output, and callers (aws_create, gcp_up) must
# check idle_guard_enabled too so they skip embedding user-data entirely.

# have it attached by the time `wait instance-running` returns. The single

# PREVIOUS session's now-wrong HostName in place. Nothing in the old output
# distinguished that silent staleness from a host that has no public IP on
# purpose, so the exhausted-budget case below says so explicitly.
#
# "Not yet" for retry purposes means any of: an empty value, the AWS CLI's
# literal "None" rendering of a null scalar, or an outright API-call failure
# (throttling / a transient error — exactly the case worth retrying).

# unused group per repo while *looking* like the ingress had been repaired.
# (repo#176's "no new SG accumulates per invocation" property, asserted by the
# suite, says the same thing.) The same limitation applies whenever a reused
# instance is attached to some OTHER group (created outside this tooling, or
# before repo#176): the group refreshed here is not the one guarding it, and
# that group has to be fixed by hand.
#
# --no-create also never WIDENS an existing rule on a failed IP detection — see

# and the run fails closed (exit 2) unless there is already a rule to preserve.
