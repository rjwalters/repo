# Repo Skills

General-purpose tools for keeping a git repository healthy and productive. The
hygiene commands are **interactive** — they report findings and discuss fixes
with the user before making changes. The environment commands (`remote`) stand
up infrastructure only after showing exactly what they will create and what it
costs.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [[help]] | Explain the installed `/repo:*` commands — what each does, where to start |
| [[audit]] | Full sweep — runs all hygiene checks, produces a summary report |
| [[reset]] | Back to baseline — review stale worktrees/branches/stashes, sync with remote, return to the default branch |
| [[tidy]] | Tidy up — build artifacts, caches, temp files, empty dirs |
| [[remote]] | Launch a cloud dev session (GCP or AWS) with this repo ready to go, then open SSH |
| [[update-tools]] | Check installed tool packages (Loom, Anvil, …) against their sources and offer updates |
| [[branches]] | Branch & worktree hygiene — merged PRs, orphaned branches, stale worktrees |
| [[gitignore]] | Gitignore hygiene — over-ignored files, under-ignored build artifacts |
| [[links]] | Internal cross-references — markdown links, CLAUDE.md paths, skill graph |
| [[orphans]] | Files with no references — dead scripts, stale data, outputs without sources |
| [[readme]] | README accuracy vs actual directory contents |

## When to Use

- After finishing a task, to get back to a known-good state (`reset`)
- After a large refactor, consolidation, or import (`audit`, `links`, `readme`)
- When the working tree feels messy (`tidy`, `orphans`)
- When `git branch` output has grown unmanageable (`branches`)
- When local hardware isn't enough or you need a clean Linux box (`remote`)
- Periodically, to keep installed tool packages current (`update-tools`)
- Periodically (monthly) as general hygiene (`audit`)
- Before a demo, handoff, or onboarding (clean up before they arrive)

## Principles

1. **Report first, fix second.** Never silently change files or create
   infrastructure. Show findings (or the exact provisioning plan), discuss,
   then act on what the user approves.
2. **Scope matters.** Most hygiene commands accept an optional path argument to
   limit scope (e.g., `/repo:readme docs/`). Without it, they scan the full repo.
3. **General by design.** These commands make no assumptions about org,
   project structure, or infrastructure. Anything repo-specific is read from
   the consumer repo's own files (CLAUDE.md conventions, `.claude/remote.json`),
   never hardcoded.
4. **Don't be noisy.** Only flag things that are actually wrong or confusing.
   A missing README in a tiny utility directory isn't worth flagging.
